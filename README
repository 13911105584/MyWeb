MyWeb is an iOS app that creates an interactive 3D web of a user's Facebook friends based on photo tags.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: Swift, Facebook API, SceneKit, Force Directed Algorithm
 
MOTIVATION
One weekend I grew tired of working on my KnifeLife app all day, so I decided to dig into my backlog of app ideas and pulled out this idea. I find social networks fascinating and wanted a way to view my own network through facebook. 

I used facebooks API to pull all of the tagged names in each of a user's photos and organized these names into a graph. I then created a force directed graph algorithm to spatially organize each of the names.

This was a fun project as it allowed me to use Facebook's SDK as well as Apple's underappreciated SceneKit
